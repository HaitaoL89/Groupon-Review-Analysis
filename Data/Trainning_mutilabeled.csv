"we ordered dinner take out as this was part of the option in the groupon we purchased. Vinoco gave us such hard time for redeemed the groupon when we placed the dinner order to go via telephone. we explained and read the fine print on the groupon to them. after 10 mins, the manager from Vinoco ""approved"" the order. However, they gave us more hard time when we pick up the food. We presented a print out of groupon and was told it was not good enough. They insist to see a copy of e mail confirmation from groupon for this purchase which I never had to do so with other vendors. Vinoco acted like they do not wanted to accepted the groupon.

"So I finally got excited for finally a girls night out as it has been over a year of dinner and drinks. 

Found this place from Yelp and it showed good reviews - great thing was there was also a Groupon for this - I felt like a winner. 

Well 1st off I did not feel like a winner when we got there. The place had some people but for a Saturday it was definitely light. 

The waiter we had seemed very flustered and very aggressive when he spoke which is not what you want from a waiter. We asked for recomendations on which Sangria's tasted good and the comment was kind of rude.. Comment was similar to Well the Sangria has to be good since its on the top of the menu.. 

Umm well not everything on the top of the menu means its good... 

So I ordered the Red Sangria and my other girlfriends ordered the white.
When the drinks came - boy was the taste a hit in the face. Not sure if it was the apples or something but it was bad - the apples tasted like moldy dish towels and the wine had that hint of taste too. It was pretty bad - we downed it anyways because our rule was to never waste alcohol. 

After that drink i just stuck it out with an old fashion glass of red wine. 
My girlfriend decided to still get fancy and try a flight of white - which when she asked if it was good - he said Yeah its white wines and thats why its on our board.. 

We then just wondered if thats just his personality to be snarky.

Food wise - things ordered:

HAM & TRUFFLED MUSHROOM FLATBREAD - really good, definitely enjoyed this the most

Steak Roll - was pretty tasty as well

PARRILLADA BOARD - skewers were ok - an we think there was a sausage (Chorizo) skewer which lacked flavor in all ways - tasted like it was boiled to death and left in water to lose even more flavor. 

One other note. The Groupon I purchased stated very clearly ""$40 Value Worth of Tapas: Valid Any Day, Dinner Only"". When I showed it to him he said ok no problem, I need the Groupon now. I had no problem giving it to him but when I mentioned oh today is Saturday - buy 1 drink get the other 1/2 off - he said oh you don't get that promotion because your using Groupon...In my head I said Ummm WTF! The Groupon clearly states on TAPAS.... but I decided not to fight it as I wanted to have a good night.

I was really hoping to find a nice tapas place closer to me but i guess the search will still remain.

I would not be coming back as I know places that are much better and less expensive.",0,0,0,0,1

"All of our food was beyond delicious. Unfortunately because most of the plates are tapas sized, the portions were too small given the cost of each dish. Even with our $40 coupon, we still paid $60 for our 4 dishes, 2 drinks, and tip. If the prices were lowered or the dishes were to grow in size, I wouldn't hesitate returning, but for now I simply can't justify the cost.",1,0,0,1,1

"The wine tasting wasn't bad. There was a good representation of NYS wineries and distilleries there and a good representation of food exhibitors with free samples. It was fairly easy access to the exhibitors and the tastings as it wasn't too crowded (went on Sunday per Groupon) and there weren't a lot of strollers. People are bringing there own wine caddies (ie, small pull along shopping carts) even though there is a very handy pickup service so you don't have to tote your wine purchases around. I had two main complaints. The wine offered for sale at the event was about 25% costlier than you would pay at a discount liquor store. The separate food vending area (not the food exhibitors) was extremely overpriced. I paid $6.00 for a small slice of pizza. Hot dogs sold for $4.00 apiece.

Everything was mixed together , wine, crafts, some food items which was nice. We had a great time trying wines that normally we would not have. There was a great selection from dry to semi dry to very sweet.  We came home with 21 bottles!  The second day was not as crowded,  some vendors had sold out of products we bought the day before but this is normal for a two day event. It advertised ""gourmet "" food but for us it was just food vendors nothing super special.  I woukd recommend this event ad someyhing fun to do.",1,1,1,0,1

Nice venue but so so crowded. The one big issue is many of the vendors only had 2 staff. Once a purchase is made now there is only one person pouring. U wait 5 mins or so sometimes per table to taste. It was kind of frustrating. Glad to see there were more food trucks but I still had very limited options due to being Celiac.,1,1,1,1,1

I am really disappointed that the entrance fee has gone up so much. The biggest disappointment was the restaurants charging full prices.

Not going ever again,1,1,1,0,0

"very crowded, most times you couldn't get close enough to taste all the brands you wanted to.  Also, last year the beer tasting was in its own tent with many, many different types to choose from and we got our own beer glass.  This year I still paid extra to test the beers and it was in the food tent with as little as 5 or 6 beers to test.  Very disappointing.  I am very happy I took advantage of the savings at groupon for this, otherwise, I would have really been dissatisfied.  Also, the free Verizon bags were ripping and where people had placed their wine bottles that they purchased, fell out of the bags and were in danger of breaking on the pavement.  Thank you, Verizon for supplying the bags, but they should be ale to support a little more weight than the papers you stuffed in them.",1,1,1,1,0

When I checked out the site prior to purchasing the groupon it was rather misleading. The food prices were way to expensive. You could buy the little food coupons for a dollar a piece at the venue. It was said on the site that most of the food was between $1.00 - $5.00 when in reality the average lunch items were priced at $11.00. With all the wine samples I felt it was very irresponsible that the food prices were so outrageous. I had to forgo a lot of the wine samples because I could not afford more food and I did not want to become overly intoxicated. Plus it really cut into the money I had allotted to buy bottles of wine from the vendors.,0,0,0,0,0

I think the Hudson valley wine and food fest is such a great idea however it is executed very poorly. I feel the fest should be more about educating people of the local wines and giving us an enjoyable experience instead it felt like a battle and competition as to who could drink the most wine. We also checked our wine and it took us over an hour to pick it up! we not only missed our bus back to the metro north station that come very infrequently. I don't think I will go back to the fest again.,1,0,1,0,0

"Very intimate and lovely experience! We initially went to Reading Terminal Market because the location was listed as such but it is actually at a different location about a 15 minute walk away.

For most of the time my party and I were the only ones there so it was basically a private tasting. We went on a Thursday afternoon.

The staff was absolutely wonderful. My questions were answered in a personable and non condescending manner. We spent almost 2 hours here and didn't feel rushed at all.

This was truly an aamzing expwrience espically for the price.

We were given so little wine to taste, there was barely enough to have a pre and post chocolate sip (and I do mean sip)of each wine. And all but one of the wines we tasted had the stale taste of a wine that had sat for too long in an opened bottle. The woman who facilitated the tasting admitted that she did not regularly taste the wines and simply regurgitated the description sheets we receive during the tasting via rote memorization as an introduction of each. Glasses were not rinsed between wines. ""Palate cleansing "" achieved by an offer of miniature oyster crackers. The entire experience lasted less than 5 minutes.

We were amazed to discover that Blue Mountain grows their own red grapes for the Merlot, etc.
Not normal in PA.
We went early (12:00PM) on Saturday and our first greeter was Vidal............a 100+ pound Rottie who is such a gentle soul. The next ""gentle soul"" was Virgil who made our stay a delightful treat.
Unlike others......no complaints.

I would suggest that even if they charge another $10 more for this, they should BUT they need to have more than 5 tastings when your menu has 20 wines. There were at least 3 more that I might have purchased if I would have been able to taste them.",1,0,0,1,1

I have been to many Wineries and the Blue Mountain Wine-Tasting experience might be the only one in history where you leave more thirsty than when you came. $40+ for 3 people to get 5 little splashes of wine and some crummy WalMart quality chocolate. Want a little cheese&crackers or to hear the live music? - that's ALL extra cash. What a RIP-OFF.,1,0,0,0,0
I thought I was going to the winery not a store in the middle of the local grocery store. The person who did the tasting was knowledgable and great but the atmosphere is not conducive to a wine and cheese pairing class.,1,0,1,0,0
"Not sure what the Groupon was about, but paying much more than just walking in for sampling, was a rip-off. First, we supposedly paid for $30 worth of wine and cheese pairing for 2, when anyone can just come in and pay $5 per glass, without the $.50 worth of cheese given. There was no tour included in the Groupon. The winery's location and building is beautiful, but the state of dissaray around us was unappealing. There were very few tables and chairs on this beautiful and spacious deck, and you had to make sure you didn't trip on the many patio umbrellas laying everywhere around you, trying to get to a table when it opens up. It is ashame that the owners don't take better care of business.",0,0,1,1,0

The standard wine tasting is 5 per person and includes 5 samples. The group on was 17 for two samplings as well two glasses and a cheese pairing.

"I was disappointed that the Wine and Cheese tasting was not what I expected.  In the future you should not have a bridal party / wine and cheese groupon customers / walk in customers just for tasting and only (2) people, the owners working.  It was Memorial Day and we specifically called ahead of time to make sure that we would be accommodated.  Also if you are going to reuse cheese that was previously out at the Sunday's tasting you probably want to keep that to yourself because as a customer that was not what I was expecting.  I was very disappointed especially because we were there for my mom's birthday.   I know there were others there that felt the same way and purchased the same groupn",1,0,0,1,0

Your poor planning should not be reflected onto the customer WHO IS PAYING YOU to be there. I also didn't like the way the wine tasting was run. I did wine tasting at Mount Hope where much bigger groups are handled effortlessly. MH uses teeny plastic cups and serves one wine at a time to all tasters. The wines are described.
